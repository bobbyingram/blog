I live in Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire with my fianc√©e [Rachael](http://www.rachaelamyreads.co.uk/).

I grew up nearby in the Burslem - the 'Mother Town' of the [Potteries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staffordshire_Potteries). I am a huge 
sports fan and will happily watch almost anything involving a ball, but I 
follow: football, cricket and basketball most closely. The teams I follow in 
each are Port Vale FC, Lancashire CCC and Golden State Warriors. 

I am a huge music buff and have been building my record collection for around 10 
years now. Some records I've bought recently are the latest LPs by
[King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard](http://kinggizzardandthelizardwizard.com/), 
[Beach House](http://www.beachhousebaltimore.com/) and 
[Kamasi Washington](https://www.kamasiwashington.com/).

I work as a Sports Analyst at [bet365](https://www.bet365.com). In this role I 
am responsible for developing and implementing models that produce odds for the 
different markets offered across the site. I am a strong advocate of the need
for models to have solid mathematical and statistical foundations and that data 
should be used wherever possible to drive probabilistic decisions.
