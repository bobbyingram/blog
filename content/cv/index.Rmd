## Profile

A lead analyst with over ten years' experience in the design and 
implementation of statistical models within the sports and financial betting
industries. 

Highly skilled in all areas of data analysis, statistical inference and 
probabilistic predictive modelling with a proven track record of delivering 
accurate, efficient and profitable models.

An adaptable programmer that is not tied to any particular language, paradigm or
tool set. A strong advocate for reproducible research practices and test driven 
development.

Currently working in a team of Sports Analysts at the world's leading online 
gambling group creating and maintaining data driven mathematical models to drive
pricing within the sports betting platform.

## Employment History

`2021-now`
__Lead Sports Analyst, bet365__ 

* Led a team of analysts in successfully delivering a new simulation-based 
American Football model used to price all bet builder bets. 
* Developed a bespoke distribution fitting algorithm to optimally construct
distributions from single point value estimates and using domain knowledge to 
infer additional constraints.

Technologies: Go, R, Python, C#, VB .NET, SQL, git, Stan

`2017-2021`
__Senior Sports Analyst, bet365__

* Designed and implemented a new Markov Chain Monte-Carlo cricket model using
10 years of historical ball-by-ball data to price 75% of in-play cricket betting. 
* Developed a new rating algorithm to optimally and efficiently rank golfers 
taking part in strokeplay tournaments. 

Technologies: R, Go, C#, VB .NET, SQL, git, Stan

`2017`
__Data Analyst - Forensics, bet365__

* Created a suite of tools to assist the forensic monitoring team in 
analysing weblog data (100GB+) and developed probabilistic models to help 
identify rogue activity within this dataset.

Technologies: R, Python, C++, Go, SQL, git, AWS, Spark

`2010-2017`
__Financial Analyst, bet365__

* Developed bespoke volatility metrics to underpin the pricing of all
models used across the financial betting platform.
* Implemented custom parametric probability distributions to adjust for the 
characteristic heavy tails of high frequency financials returns data. 
* Designed and implemented an algorithm to automatically calibrate the pricing 
models against logged data to ensure that the models operated optimally each 
trading day.
* Developed a suite of tools to analyse all bets placed on the financial betting
platform to automatically identify bots and other suspect betting patterns.
