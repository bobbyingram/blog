<h3>Review</h3>
<p>As you would expect with Dylan this is not your typical autobiography. It is as
enigmatic and mystifying as the man himself and all the better for it. For a
start Dylan almost entirely ignores the period when he was at his cultural
zenith in the mid 1960s and instead focuses on three periods: his arrival in
Greenwich Village in 1961-2 and the recordings of “New Morning” and “Oh Mercy”
in 1970 and 1989.</p>
