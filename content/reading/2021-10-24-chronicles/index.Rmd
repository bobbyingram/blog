### Review

As you would expect with Dylan this is not your typical autobiography. It is as
enigmatic and mystifying as the man himself and all the better for it. For a 
start Dylan almost entirely ignores the period when he was at his cultural 
zenith in the mid 1960s and instead focuses on three periods: his arrival in 
Greenwich Village in 1961-2 and the recordings of "New Morning" and "Oh Mercy" 
in 1970 and 1989.
