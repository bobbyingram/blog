<h3>Review</h3>
<p>Gilead is the story of John Ames; a third generation pastor from Iowa with a
weak heart who knows that he is dying. He has a younger, second wife and they
share a seven year old son. Ames knows he will not be around to see his son
become a man and decides to write his son a letter in an attempt to pass on his
life’s story and any wisdom he might have picked up along the way. It is this
long letter that forms the entire narrative of the book.</p>
<p>In the letter, Ames chronicles his final days and in the process interweaves
many stories from his life: meeting his first wife the death of their
daughter; meeting his current wife; and his journey to becoming a pastor. Within
these stories he lays out his family history and reflects on key relationships
such as that with his best friend the Reverend John Boughton and his son
Jack Boughton - whom the main plot revolves around.</p>
<p>As you would expect from a man of the cloth his reflections are told through the
prism of his deeply held Christian beliefs but the story is by no means a sermon.
It is just the honest account of a human life lived and a man searching for
meaning as his journey nears its end. It’s a study of the subtleties of
relationships and of faith told from inside the mind of one particular, ordinary
person.</p>
