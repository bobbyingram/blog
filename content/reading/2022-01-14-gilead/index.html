<h3>Review</h3>
<p>Gilead is the story of John Ames; a third generation pastor from Iowa with a
weak heart who knows that he is dying. John has a much younger second wife and
they share a seven year old son. Ames knows he will not be around to see his son
grow to become a man and decides to write him a letter in an attempt to pass on
his story and any wisdom he might have picked up along the way. It is this
long letter that forms the sole narrative of the book.</p>
<p>In his letter, Ames chronicles his final days and in doing so interweaves
stories from throughout his life: meeting his first wife and the death of their
daughter; his journey to becoming a pastor and how he met his current wife.
Within these stories he lays out his family history and reflects on
relationships such as that with his best friend the Reverend John Boughton and
his son Jack - about who the main plot revolves.</p>
<p>As you would expect from a man of the cloth his reflections are told through the
prism of his deeply held Christian beliefs but the story is by no means a sermon.
It is simply the honest account of a human life lived; and of a man searching for
meaning as his particular journey nears its end. It’s a study of the subtleties
of relationships and of faith told from inside the mind of an ordinary man.</p>
