### Review

Gilead is the story of John Ames; a third generation pastor from Iowa with a 
weak heart who knows that he is dying. John has a much younger second wife and 
they share a seven year old son. Ames knows he will not be around to see his son 
grow to become a man and decides to write him a letter in an attempt to pass on 
his story and any wisdom he might have picked up along the way. It is this 
long letter that forms the sole narrative of the book.

In his letter, Ames chronicles his final days and in doing so interweaves 
stories from throughout his life: meeting his first wife and the death of their 
daughter; his journey to becoming a pastor and how he met his current wife. 
Within these stories he lays out his family history and reflects on 
relationships such as that with his best friend the Reverend John Boughton and 
his son Jack - about who the main plot revolves.

As you would expect from a man of the cloth his reflections are told through the 
prism of his deeply held Christian beliefs but the story is by no means a sermon. 
It is simply the honest account of a human life lived; and of a man searching for 
meaning as his particular journey nears its end. It's a study of the subtleties 
of relationships and of faith told from inside the mind of an ordinary man.
