### Review

In the latest instalment of his *Time Traveller's Guide* series of social 
history books, Ian Mortimer guides us through day-to-day life in Britain during
the wider Regency period of 1779-1830. He transports us back in time to the
world of Wellington & Napoleon, Beethoven and Mozart and Wordsworth and Shelley 
to give us a sense of what everyday existence was like.

Where would you stay and how much would it cost if you arrived in London in 
March 1803? What would you eat and drink? How would you go about posting a 
letter  or travelling between towns? What would you do, where would you go and
what could be done if you were taken ill? These are the kind of questions this 
book answers. The scope and detail is encyclopaedic but, under the clever guise 
of a guide book, the narrative never becomes a boring list of facts. Instead we 
have a book filled with character and personality and a very entertaining and 
easy read.
