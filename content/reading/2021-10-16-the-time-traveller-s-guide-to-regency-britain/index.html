<h3>Review</h3>
<p>In the latest instalment of his <em>Time Traveller’s Guide</em> series of social
history books, Ian Mortimer guides us through day-to-day life in Britain during
the wider Regency period of 1779-1830. We are transported back in time to the
world of Wellington &amp; Napoleon, Beethoven and Mozart, Wordsworth and Shelley to
learn what their lives, the lives of Kings and Queens and the lives of working
folk were like, how they functioned and why things were as they were.</p>
<p>Where would you stay and how much would it cost if you arrived in London in
March 1803? What would you eat and drink? How would you go about posting a
letter or travelling between towns? What would you do, where would you go and
what could be done if you were taken ill? These are the kind of questions this
book answers. The scope and detail is encyclopaedic but, under the clever guise
of a guide book, the narrative never becomes a boring list of facts - a trap
which all too many history books fall into. Instead we have a book filled with
character and personality and a very entertaining and easy read.</p>
