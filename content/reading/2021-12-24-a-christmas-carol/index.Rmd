### Review

What is there to say about this masterpiece that has not already been written?
Everybody knows the story. Literature's quintessential miser and cynic: Ebenezer 
Scrooge spurns the offer of festive good cheer from his nephew and is planning 
on spending Christmas alone. However, on Christmas Eve he is visited by the 
ghost of his long dead business partner Jacob Marley who has been roaming the 
Earth, carrying chains tied to money boxes, as punishment for his selfish life 
of greed. Marley warns Scrooge that he has only one chance to avoid the same 
fate and that three successive spirits will visit him: Christmas Past, 
Christmas Present and Christmas Yet to Come. At the end of the night - having
travelled through space and time with these spirits - Scrooge accepts the 
error of his ways, repents and vows to change. 

The tale is so predictable and familiar that it should be boring to read it 
again but it isn't and that is all down to Dickens' great skill as an artist. 
It is easy to see why there have been so many screen adaptations as there is a 
cinematic quality to his writing. The passage where his home door knocker morphs 
into the face of Jacob Marley is a perfect example of this. The writing is so 
vivid that the work of a director is done! 

It's a brilliant short story and a must read every Christmas.
