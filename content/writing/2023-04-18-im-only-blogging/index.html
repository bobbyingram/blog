<p>Welcome.</p>
<p>I made a New Year’s resolution to try and be more creative in 2023. So, with
that in mind, I will be trying my hand at a bit of writing in my spare time.</p>
<p>They say you can only hope to write songs as good as your record collection…
so expect some very amateurish imitations of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Hemingway">Hemingway</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Camus">Camus</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Kerouac">Kerouac</a>!</p>
<p>The name of this website comes from one of my favourite Bob Dylan songs:
<a href="https://www.bobdylan.com/songs/its-alright-ma-im-only-bleeding/">It’s Alright Ma (I’m Only Bleeding)</a>.
Therefore, what better way to begin, than by trying to write another three
verses of this masterpiece; with a modern twist. A cynical world view,
alliteration and internal rhymes are the name of the game here.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Silent screens dictate the rules<br />
As folk seek solace in the cyber cesspool<br />
Chasing hits and likes from online ghouls<br />
Faking content to make their users drool<br />
Forsake themselves for digital jewels<br />
And wonder why they feel empty</p>
<p>For the market’s hunger knows no bounds<br />
It consumes the soul as greed is crowned<br />
In a plastic palace raised from the ground<br />
While the endless race to grow and compound<br />
Makes it impossible for the truth to be found<br />
That enough is more than plenty</p>
<p>In this age of noise, where silence flees<br />
We shout for meaning, drowning in the seas<br />
Of shallow thoughts and easy tease<br />
We drift apart with inevitable ease<br />
Yet before the screens we’re on our knees<br />
Praying for an iPhone 20</p>
<p>But don’t mind too much what I write<br />
It’s only a feather in a cannon fight<br />
It’s alright, Ma, I’m only blogging</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apologies to all Dylanolgists out there!</p>
<p>And now for the man himself:</p>
