<p>Well, it’s April 2023 and I promised myself this year I’d try to be a bit more
creative and do a bit of writing. It’ll mostly be nonsense and no doubt a poor
imitation of the writers I love but you can only hope to write songs as good as
your record collection.</p>
<p>Anyway the name of my website comes from the great Bob Dylan song: <a href="https://www.bobdylan.com/songs/its-alright-ma-im-only-bleeding/">It’s Alright Ma
(I’m Only Bleeding)</a>.
So I thought it would be a nice way to begin by trying to write another three
verses of this masterpiece but with a modern twist.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Silent screens dictate the rules<br />
as people seek solace in the cyber cesspool<br />
Chasing hits and likes from online ghouls<br />
Faking content to make their users drool<br />
Forsake themselves for digital jewels<br />
and wonder why they feel empty</p>
<p>For the market’s hunger knows no bounds<br />
it consumes the soul as greed is crowned<br />
in a plastic palace raised from the ground<br />
While the endless race to grow and compound<br />
Makes it impossible for the truth to be found<br />
That enough is more than plenty</p>
<p>In this age of noise, where silence flees<br />
We shout for meaning, drowning in the seas<br />
of shallow thoughts and easy tease<br />
we drift apart with inevitable ease<br />
yet before the screens we’re on our knees<br />
praying for an iPhone 20</p>
<p>But don’t mind too much what I write<br />
it’s only a feather in a cannon fight<br />
It’s alright, Ma, I’m only blogging</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apologies to all Dylanolgists out there!</p>
<p>And now for the man himself doing it properly:</p>
