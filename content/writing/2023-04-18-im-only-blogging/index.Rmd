Well, it's April 2023 and I promised myself this year I'd try to be a bit more
creative and do a bit of writing. It'll mostly be nonsense and no doubt a poor 
imitation of the writers I love but you can only hope to write songs as good as 
your record collection.

Anyway the name of my website comes from the great Bob Dylan song: [It's Alright Ma 
(I’m Only Bleeding)](https://www.bobdylan.com/songs/its-alright-ma-im-only-bleeding/).
So I thought it would be a nice way to begin by trying to write another three 
verses of this masterpiece but with a modern twist.

> Silent screens dictate the rules   
as people seek solace in the cyber cesspool  
Chasing hits and likes from online ghouls  
Faking content to make their users drool   
Forsake themselves for digital jewels  
and wonder why they feel empty   
> 
> For the market's hunger knows no bounds  
it consumes the soul as greed is crowned   
in a plastic palace raised from the ground   
While the endless race to grow and compound  
Makes it impossible for the truth to be found   
That enough is more than plenty   
>  
> In this age of noise, where silence flees   
We shout for meaning, drowning in the seas  
of shallow thoughts and easy tease  
we drift apart with inevitable ease   
yet before the screens we're on our knees    
praying for an iPhone 20 
>       
> But don't mind too much what I write  
it's only a feather in a cannon fight  
It’s alright, Ma, I’m only blogging 

Apologies to all Dylanolgists out there!

And now for the man himself:
