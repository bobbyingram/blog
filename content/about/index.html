<p>I live in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire with my wife
<a href="https://www.etsy.com/uk/shop/AmyAndReg">Rachael</a>, our son
<a href="harrison.jpeg">Harrison</a> and our daughter <a href="amelie.jpeg">Amelie</a>.</p>
<p>I grew up in nearby Burslem - the ‘Mother Town’ of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staffordshire_Potteries">Potteries</a>.</p>
<p>I’m a season ticket holder at <a href="https://www.port-vale.co.uk/">Port Vale FC</a> and
also support <a href="https://yorkshireccc.com/">Yorkshire CCC</a> and

<p>Alongside an ever-growing record collection,
<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/live:bbc_6music">Radio 6 Music</a> forms the
soundtrack to my life.</p>
<p>I’m a real bookworm and always have a book on the go. You can see what I’ve been
reading recently <a href="/reading/reading">here</a>.</p>
<p>I work as the Principal Sports Analyst at <a href="https://www.bet365.com">bet365</a>. We
design and implement probabilistic models to drive the pricing of bets across a
range of sports.</p>
